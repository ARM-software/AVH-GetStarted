# Arm Virtual Hardware - Basic Example

This project demonstrates how to setup a development workflow with cloud-based
Continuous Integration (CI) for testing an embedded application.

The embedded program implements a set of simple unit tests for execution on
a Arm Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) models. Code development and debug can be done
locally, for example with [CMSIS-Build](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/develop/Build/html/index.html) and [Keil MDK](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/embedded/keil-mdk) tools.

Automated test execution is managed with GitHub Actions and gets triggered on
every code change in the repository. The program gets built and run on [Arm
Virtual Hardware](https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/simulation/virtual-hardware) cloud infrastructure in AWS and the test results can
be then observed in repository's [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ARM-software/AVH-GetStarted/actions).

## Local build and debug

For developing the tests on the local machine one needs to clone this
repository into a local workspace.

### Building on command line

Open a command prompt in the local workspace. The following instructions assume
Python is installed. If one doesn't want to go the Python way one can issue the
individual command, manually. The CMSIS-Build command `cbuild` and the FVP executable `VHT_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U55` are expected in the
system `PATH`.

In order to use the `build.py` script to conveniently execute the required commands,
one need to install some Python requirements listed in `requirements.txt`:

```text
~/AVH-GetStarted/basic $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the required Python packages are installed one can run the script to
build the example:

```text
~/AVH-GetStarted/basic $ ./build.py -t debug build
[debug](build:run_cbuild) bash -c cbuild.sh --quiet basic.debug.cprj
[debug](build:run_cbuild) bash succeeded with exit code 0

Matrix Summary
==============

target    build    run
--------  -------  -----
debug     success  (skip)

~/AVH-GetStarted/basic $ ls -lah Objects/basic.axf

-rw-r--r-- 1 **** 4096 64K Nov 25 10:59 Objects/basic.axf
```

The `build.py` script automatically creates a timestamped archive of the build results
in a file `basic-<timestamp>.zip`. One can extract this into another workspace at a
later point in time to inspect the result, e.g. run the tests in a debugger.

### Execute on command line

Open a command prompt in the local workspace. The following instructions assume
Python is installed. If one don't want to go the Python way one can issue the
individual command, manually.

```text
~/AVH-GetStarted/basic $ ./build.py -t debug run
[debug](run:run_fvp) VHT_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U55.EXE -q --stat --simlimit 1 -f fvp_config.txt Objects/basic.axf
[debug](run:run_fvp) VHT_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U55.EXE succeeded with exit code 0
::set-output name=badge::Unittest-3%20of%204%20passed-yellow

Matrix Summary
==============

target    build    run
--------  -------  -----
debug     (skip)   3/4
```

The summary lists out the number of test cases passed and totally executed.
This example intentionally has one failing test case. Inspect the xunit result
file to see the details:

```text
~/AVH-GetStarted/basic $ cat basic-<timestamp>.xunit
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<testsuites disabled="0" errors="0" failures="1" tests="4" time="0.0">
        <testsuite disabled="0" errors="0" failures="1" name="Cloud-CI basic tests" skipped="0" tests="4" time="0">
                <testcase name="test_my_sum_pos" file="main.c" line="57"/>
                <testcase name="test_my_sum_neg" file="main.c" line="58"/>
                <testcase name="test_my_sum_fail" file="main.c" line="48">
                        <failure type="failure" message="Expected 2 Was 0"/>
                </testcase>
                <testcase name="test_my_sum_zero" file="main.c" line="60"/>
        </testsuite>
</testsuites>
```

This reveals that the test assertion in `main.c` line 48 failed.

### Understanding the `build.py` script

The `build.py` script is written using the `python-matrix-runner` Python
package. Find more detailed documentation for this Python package on its
[PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/python-matrix-runner/).

This section puts some parts of the build script into the spotlight.

#### Test report converter `class UnityReport`

The `class UnityReport` is implemented as a `ReportFilter` so that it can
later be used in a test report chain (see section about commands below).

The relevant part here is `stream` property that receives a data stream
(standard output of the model) and translates it into JUnit format. This
is done by pattern matching (using regular expression) on the expected
Unity framework output. Each found test case with its result is converted
into a `junit_xml.TestCase` taken from the Python package `junit-xml`.

#### Configuration axes `@matrix_axis`

The `python-matrix-runner` has built-in support for matrix build configurations.
In case of this trivial GetStarted example only a single configuration `debug`
is used. This is done by specifying a project specific `Enum` per degree of
freedom listing the configuration values. This example only has one axis
(`target`) with one value (`debug`). More elaborated use-cases may add further
axes for support of different compilers, optimization levels or target devices.

#### Build actions `@matrix_action`

The build script can offer different top-level actions the user can trigger
from the command line. In this example these are only `build` and `run`. Each
action is defined by the according method.

An action method must at least `yield` one shell command to be executed.
Complex actions can be composed from multiple shell commands interleaved
with additional Python code. In this basic example additional Python code
is used for some post-processing of the shell command results such as
creating an zip archive with the build output.

#### Build commands `@matrix_command`

Each shell command (required to compose the actions) is defined by a method
returning an array with the command line parts, see
[subprocess.run](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run)
for details.

A command can be further customized, for instance by attaching a `test_report`.
The `test_report` is created by applying a chain of `ReportFiler`'s to the
output of the command. In the basic example the output of the FVP
model is captured (`ConsoleReport`), the Unity output between
the known text markers is cropped (`CropReport`), and the remaining data
is converted into JUnit format (`UnityReport`).


### Build and debug in MDK

[Run with MDK-Professional](https://arm-software.github.io/AVH/main/infrastructure/html/run_mdk_pro.html)
explains in details the tool setup and project configuration for running an
MDK project on Arm Virtual Hardware.

For this example, import the `basic.debug.cprj` in MDK. Before launching the debug session one needs to
verify the debugger configuration:

- Bring up the _Options for target..._ dialog from the tool bar.
- Navigate to the _Debug_ pane and select _Use: Models ARMv8-M Debugger_.
- Next, click on the _Settings_ button to bring up the _Models ARMv8-M Target Driver Setup_ dialog.
- Select in the as the _Command_ field the model executable for Corstone SSE-300
  with Ethos-U55 (filename is: `VHT_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U55.exe`
  in the location where Virtual Hardware models are installed).
- Set `cpu0` as the _Target_.
- Browse for the _Configuration File_ and select `mdk_config.txt`.

Now, start the debug session and the model executable should pop up. By default,
MDK stops execution when reaching `main`. Set a breakpoint to line 37 and
continue execution. Hitting the breakpoint one can single step the code under
test to figure out the issue. In this case the issue is obvious:
`1 + (-1) != 2`.

## Running tests in GitHub Actions CI

The repository defines a workflow to build and run the tests using
GitHub Actions on every change i.e., *push* and *pull_request* triggers.

To make this work the repository needs to be configured, see Prerequisites
above.

On every change, the workflow is kicked off executing the following steps.

- Execute build and test inside an EC2 instance\
  The [AVH Client for Python](https://github.com/ARM-software/avhclient) is used to
  - create new EC2 instance
  - upload the workspace to the EC2 instance using a S3 storage bucket;
  - run the command line build;
  - execute the test image using the AVH model
  - download the output into the workspace.
  - terminate the EC2 instance
- Extract and post-process test output, including
  - conversion of the log file into XUnit format.
- Archive build/test output\
  The image, log file and XUnit report are attached as a build artifact for
  later analysis.
- Publish test results
