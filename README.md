# Getting started with Arm Virtual Hardware Targets

![Create, debug, and test](./create_debug_test.png)

Arm Virtual Hardware Targets (VHT) are precise simulation models of Cortex-M device sub-systems and are designed for complex software verification and testing. This allows simulation-based test automation of various software workloads, including unit tests, integration tests, and fault injection. Refer to the [Arm Virtual Hardware documentation](https://arm-software.github.io/VHT/main/overview/html/index.html) for more information.

This repository contains a simple getting started project that you can use as a template.
