# Getting started with Arm Virtual Hardware

![Create, debug, and test](./create_debug_test.png)

[**Arm Virtual Hardware**](https://www.arm.com/virtual-hardware) provides simulation models, software tooling, and infrastructure that can be integrated into CI/CD and MLOps development flows. The simulation models (Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs)) are an implementation of a Cortex-M device sub-systems and are designed for complex software verification and testing. This allows simulation-based test automation of various software workloads, including unit tests, integration tests, and fault injection. Refer to the [Arm Virtual Hardware documentation](https://arm-software.github.io/AVH/main/overview/html/index.html) for more information.

**Note:**
  - This is a template repository that can be used as starting point for own validation projects that utilize Arm Virtual Hardware.
